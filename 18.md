"My whole life, all I ever wanted to do was travel and see the world," Blaker recalled.

"I married very young and never did get to finish my degree," Blaker said. "I was helping out my dad and worked in every area of the company. We started developing service manuals for automotive companies. My father did the technical writing, and I did all the typing on an old typewriter."
