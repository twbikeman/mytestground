## On the move
"My whole life, all I ever wanted to do was travel and see the world," Blaker recalled.

"I married very young and never did get to finish my degree," Blaker said. "I was helping out my dad and worked in every area of the company. We started developing service manuals for automotive companies. My father did the technical writing, and I did all the typing on an old typewriter."

When electronics grew more sophisticated, car companies asked the small family business to start porviding more manuals and then design training program for technicians. That was Lori Blaker's area of expertise, training people.

## Singing her praises

"She literally moves mountains," Pieter Martiz, general manager of Nissan Middle East in Dubai, said, "And she is a very humble person, truly."

Oaklan Country Executive L. Brooks Patterson, a friend and mentor, has worked on business initiatives with Blaker for a decade.

"She takes on these huge efforts and brings them home," he said. "Last I saw her, she was deeply involved with the effort to stop sex trafficking of young girls. And now this award from Oslo."

## Leaving a legacy

"Being a CEO, running a business--you can do that and still have a heart," Blaker said. "So many companies and leaders seem to forget that. It's our duty as leaders to lead by example."

The visible impact on those who benefit strengthens her resolve.

"You wouldn't believe the women, young and old, I've met," Blaker said. "When you see htem look up with amazement in their eyes because you are actually stopping to help them or talk to them or ask them about their life--the smiles you get can just make your day, your week, you life worthwhile."
